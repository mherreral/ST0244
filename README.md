# Unification algorithm in java

## Made by: Manuela Herrera LÃ³pez and Samuel Palacios Bernate

The final lab for programming languages was implementing the Robinson's Unification algorithm in some language,
we choose java for doing so. The algorithm works by implementing the unification method and it's auxiliar methods like
remove unnecessary parentheses, find the principal "->" of our constraint, finding if there are unnecessary parentheses, and
finding the free variables from a line, taking apart reading from a file the constraints.
The algorithm says if the set of constraints unify or if it doesn't, and returns the set of substitutions the algorithm did for unifying
the expression.

Operating System: Linux 5.3.11-1-MANJARO

Programming language: Java
Complied with openjdk 11.0.5

### Getting Started

The proyect has a file called Makefile, which is in charge of compiling the program, it runs the set of test cointained in the "test"
directory

### Acknowledgments

We thank Santiago Hidalgo for providing the logical implementation of the "unnecessaryParentheses" method.
